# Networking Project 1 - Router Connecting Two Networks

This Packet Tracer project demonstrates basic routing between two LANs using a Cisco router, two switches, and four PCs.

# Topology

-2 PCs in Subnet A (192.168.10.0/24)
-2 PCs in Subnet B (192.168.20.0/24)
-1 Cisco Router (R1)
-2 Cisco Switches (SW1 and SW2)

#Equipment Used

#Technology Used

-Cisco Packet Tracer
-IPv4 Subnetting
Router interface configuration
Default gateway setup
ICMP (ping ) testing

#Summary 

Each LAN is connected to a seperate switch and routed to a Cisco router. Static IPs are manually assigned. The connectivity is tested successfully using ping.
